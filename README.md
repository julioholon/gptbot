## About

This is a very simple Discord.js bot supporting v14 and slash command interactions.

## Setup

First of all, go to [Discord developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create or choose the bot you want to host, go to the bot tab, and click on `Regenerate token`, and then copy the token.

After this, go to the Secrets tab, in the `key` enter `BOTTOKEN` and `BOTCLIENTID` and in the `value` fields, from the values you copied from the Discord developer dashboard. (The Cliend ID is on the OAuth2 -> General page)

## Commands

Inside the `commands` folder you can create any file like `hello.js` and it will be automatically identified as a command.
Whenever you restart the bot, it will automatically reload all the commands.

## Hosting
